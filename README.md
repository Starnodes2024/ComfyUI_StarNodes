- ‚≠ê Star Seven Inputs(txt): Text concatenation with optional inputs. Works as automatic switch and concatenates multiple inputs
- ‚≠ê Star Seven Inputs(latent): Switch that automatically passes the first provided latent to the output
- ‚≠ê Star Text Filter: Cleans string text by removing text between two given words (default), removing text before a specific word, removing text after a specific word, removing empty lines, removing all whitespace, or stripping whitespace from line edges
- ‚≠ê Star Face Loader: Specialized node for handling face-related operations. Image loader that works like the "load image" node but saves images in a special faces-folder for later use.

## Installation

### Via ComfyUI Manager (Recommended)
Search for "Starnodes" in ComfyUI Manager and install

### Manual Installation
1. Open CMD within your custom nodes folder
2. Run: `git clone https://github.com/Starnodes2024/ComfyUI_StarNodes`
3. Restart ComfyUI

Find the nodes under "‚≠êStarNodes" category or search for "star" in the node browser.

### Wildcards
You will find the wildcards in the wildcards folder of your ComfyUI main folder. If you add your own just copy the new files to this location.

## Wildcard Rules in the Star Wildcards Node

### Basic Wildcard Syntax
- Wildcards are defined using double underscores: `__wildcard_name__`
- The node looks for text files in the `wildcards` folder of your ComfyUI installation
- When a wildcard is encountered, a random line from the corresponding text file is selected

### Folder Structure
- Wildcards can be organized in subfolders
- To use a wildcard in a subfolder, use the syntax: `folder\__wildcard_name__`
- The system will look for the file at `[ComfyUI base path]/wildcards/folder/wildcard_name.txt`

### Random Options
- You can use curly braces `{}` with pipe symbols `|` to choose randomly between options
- Example: `{option1|option2|option3}` will randomly select one of the options
- You can even include wildcards inside these options: `{__wildcard1__|__wildcard2__}`

### Nested Wildcards
- Wildcards can be nested within other wildcards
- The system supports up to 10 levels of recursion to prevent infinite loops
- When a wildcard contains another wildcard, the nested wildcard is also processed

### Seed Behavior
- The node takes a seed parameter that determines the randomization
- Each prompt input (1-7) uses a different seed offset to ensure variety
- Each wildcard within a prompt also gets a unique seed based on its position

### Error Handling
- If a wildcard file doesn't exist, the wildcard name itself is used as text
- If a wildcard file exists but is empty, the wildcard name is used as fallback
- If there's an error processing a wildcard, it falls back to using the wildcard name

The Star Wildcards node allows you to combine up to 7 different prompts, each with their own wildcards, which are then joined together with spaces to create the final output string.

- Supports recursive wildcard processing up to 10 layers

For InfiniteYou Insightface is a requirement. If you are having trouble installing it (windows) here is how to fix that problem:
1. Download that insightface wheel that fits your python version from: 
https://github.com/Gourieff/Assets/tree/main/Insightface
2. open command and input:
